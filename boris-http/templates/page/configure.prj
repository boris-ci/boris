<p>
    Welcome to boris, since this is your first time we
    have to do some configuration... If you don't want
    to see this screen on first load, set the <code>BORIS_TENANCY</code>
    environment variable to <code>single</code> or <code>multi</code>.
</p>
<form action="/configure" method="post">
    <button name="single" class="btn" type="submit">single tenancy</button>
    <button name="multi" class="btn" type="submit">multi tenancy</button>
</form>
